## Getting started

- Clone project and open in VSCode
- Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adoptopenjdk:17)
- Play or entry point is Main.java, look for Run option in code.  This eanbles Spring to load
- Java source (src/main/java/...) has Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship.
- HTML source (src/main/resources/...) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by defaul in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building an "@Controller"
- Deploy
